zero to 100 in 100 days

###What is this repo all about?

First of all, it does not contain any code. Cause I cannot code. But it contains information about my journey towards learning code. More specifically towards learning Javascript. More specifically the MEAN-stack. Because someone told me it was a mean stack to learn.

###Why learn this?
Because I like to build things. And to master it.

###How will I do it?
I will have a TODO-list that I will try TO DO. Here it goes (in no particular order):

 - Node.js - it seem to be where it all lives on the server
 - Bower vs npm - what is the difference and what should I use where?
 - MongoDB with Mongoose - to store things for later
 - Express - to transfer things from users to DB and back again
 - Gulp for task automation - it seems like some of the non-creative stuff can be automated away
 - AngularJS - to interact with users 
 - nodemon - same reason as Gulp
 - git and github - because it seems to be a good idea to keep track of versions


###How will I do it?
After work, when kids are asleep. With the help of Google, Pluralsight, Webstorm and a Lenovo Yoga 3.
